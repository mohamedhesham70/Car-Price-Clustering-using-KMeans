# Car-Price-Clustering-using-KMeans

Car Price Clustering using KMeans 🚗💸

📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and understanding the pricing patterns of used cars by leveraging data-driven techniques. The goal is to uncover hidden insights from the dataset and group cars into meaningful clusters based on their price ranges. This can help in better decision-making for both buyers and sellers.

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains various features about cars, such as:

Brand and model

Year of manufacture

Price

Fuel type

Transmission

Engine capacity

Mileage and other attributes

It was collected from a real-world car marketplace and reflects the actual distribution of car prices in the market.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We start by exploring the dataset to understand its structure and identify any potential issues. This includes:

Checking for missing or null values

Summarizing numerical features (e.g., average price, mileage)

Visualizing price distribution to detect skewness or outliers

Examining the relationships between different features

The goal of this phase is to get a clear understanding of the data before applying any machine learning techniques.

🧹 Data Cleaning
Data cleaning ensures the quality and reliability of the dataset. In this phase:

Outliers are detected and removed using statistical techniques such as the Interquartile Range (IQR)

Irrelevant or redundant columns are dropped

Missing values are handled appropriately

This step prepares the data for meaningful analysis.

📊 Clustering Analysis
Instead of predicting exact prices, we use unsupervised learning (specifically, KMeans Clustering) to group the cars into different price segments.

Each car is assigned to a cluster based on its features, allowing us to:

Identify pricing tiers (e.g., budget, mid-range, premium)

Understand market segmentation

Visualize how prices are grouped within the dataset

Clustering is especially useful when we want to analyze data without labeled outcomes.

📈 Visual Insights
We use various plots and graphs to visualize:

The distribution of prices

The number of cars in each cluster

How price clusters vary across other features like year or fuel type

These visualizations make it easier to interpret the model results and draw actionable conclusions.

💡 Key Takeaways
Car prices are not evenly distributed and contain significant outliers

KMeans can effectively group cars into price categories

Clustering provides insights into hidden patterns in the market
